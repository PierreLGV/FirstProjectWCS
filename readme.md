# About us

Members of the project : Daniel Deutsch, Pierre Langevin, Edouard De Laage, Louise Foussat

We decided to use black and white pictures in order to provide a sober design to the website. 

We made 4 pages : 
- Home page
- Gallery
- About me 
- Contact

The presence of a burger menu all the time (even on desktop) was a bias with the aim of valuing the pictures.
